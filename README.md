Project Writeup and Reflection 

1. Project overview
For this assignment, I ended up using the "Pride and Prejudice" text that was used for the in class exercise, for reasons I will discuss in the reflection portion. I ended up doing a simple sentiment analysis of the most common words within the text in order to see if there was some sort of undertone present amongst these words, whether it be positive or negative. This would theoretically provide insight into what kind of tone the author was trying to set through the language they used.

2. Implementation 
The two key components of the analysis is finding the most common words and then conducting a sentiment analysis on those words to see if there is some pattern in their undertones.

3. Results 
The results of the sentiment analysis were rather inconclusive, at least in the sense that it did not support my hypothesis that the author would use either negative or positive undertones in the language to set the scene in the book. The results showed that nearly all of the most common words were almost entirely neutral. 
{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}
{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}
{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}
{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}
{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}
However, this does not completely disprove my hypothesis because most of the top 20 common words are conjuctions or names and therefore not necessarily representative of the language used throughout the text. If I were to conduct further analysis, I would have to find a way to exclude such conjuctive words.

4. Reflection 
All in all this process was not smooth at all and could greatly be improved upon if it were to be done again. For one, I didn't give myself enough time to thoroughly go through the assignment which ultimately resulted in unnecessary stress and ineffeciencies. The first step in the assignment ended up being the most time consuming for me, as I constantly ran into all sorts of errors trying to source a text despite following instructions step-by-step and even using example code from class as a model/reference. After approximately 8-10 hours spread across several day of attempting to get the text sourced properly, I decided it'd be a smarter use of my time if I instead just moved on and used the "Pride and Prejudice" text as it was being read properly. Had I given myself more time to complete the assignment, I could have figured out the errors or at least seek help to fix these errors. This is a lesson I will carry with me moving forward in this course and beyond.
